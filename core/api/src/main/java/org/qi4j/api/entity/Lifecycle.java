/**
 * Lifecycle interface for all Composites.
 * <p/>
 * This Lifecycle interface is a built-in feature of the Qi4j runtime, similar to the Initializable interface.
 * Any Mixin that implements this interface AND is part of an EntityComposite will have these two methods called
 * upon creation/removal of the EntityComposite instance to/from the EntityStore. Meaning, the create method is called
 * only when the identifiable EntityComposite is created the first time, and not when it is read from its persisted
 * state and created into memory.
 * <p/>
 * Example;
 * <code><pre>
 * public interface System
 * {
 *     Property&lt;User&gt; admin();
 * }
 *
 * public class SystemAdminMixin<LifeCycle>
 *     implements System, Lifecyle, ...
 * {
 *      &#64;Structure private UnitOfWork uow;
 *      &#64;This private Identity meAsIdentity;
 *
 *      public void create()
 *      {
 *          String thisId = meAsIdentity.identity().get();
 *          EntityBuilder builder = uow.newEntityBuilder( thisId + ":1", UserComposite.class );
 *          User admin = builder.newInstance();
 *          admin.set( admin );
 *      }
 *
 *      public void remove()
 *      {
 *          uow.remove( admin.get() );
 *      }
 * }
 *
 * &#64;Mixins( SystemAdminMixin.class )
 * public interface SystemEntity extends System, EntityComposite
 * {}
 *
 * </pre></code>
