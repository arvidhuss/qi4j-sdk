<h1>EntityStore for Google App Engine</h1>

<p>It is not possible to test this code fully without running within the Google AppEngine itself. Therefor the
tests has been moved to their own module in the qi4j-tests GIT repository. The tests are not run as standard JUnit
tests, but as a Web application itself. It uses the standard Qi4j Entity Store test suite, but the runner is
special built for this purpose and the result comes out as a simple web page.</p>

<p>You will also need a Google AppEngine account to run them.</p>
